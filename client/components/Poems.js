        <h3>Seem to bleed into one another</h3>
        <h3>A phase</h3>
        <h3>That's taking tooo long to past</h3>
        <h3>Aftermath</h3>
        <h3>Of trying to make things work</h3>

        <h3>I just want to lay in bed</h3>
        <h3>And melt away</h3>
        <h3>But you</h3>
        <h3>Strive for greatness</h3>
        <h3>Claim your awards</h3>
        <h3>You deserve it champ</h3>
        <h3>But wait</h3>
        <h3>How many trophies can</h3>
        <h3>You take</h3>
        <h3>To your grave</h3>
        <h3>Are there walls</h3>
        <h3>For all your certificates</h3>
        <h3>And plaques</h3>
        <h3>In heaven?</h3>

        <h2>Gray Concrete</h2>
        <h3>Tar black streets </h3>
        <h3>As far as the eyes can see</h3>
        <h3>It lacks beauty</h3>
        <h3>Our space reflects</h3>
        <h3>Our minds</h3>
        <h3>Cramped and cluttered</h3>
        <h3>Too close together</h3>
        <h3>Its a maze</h3>
        <h3>We are trapped within it</h3>
        <h3>Big Apple</h3>
        <h3>She aint that pretty</h3>

        <h3>I dont have one for you</h3>
        <h3>But theres space for you in my closet</h3>
        <h3>Where I keep the rest of my skeletons</h3>
        <h3>Never thought youd be one to</h3>
